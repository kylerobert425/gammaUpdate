# M2 Gamma Update
R project to bulk analyze AWS data and MS Form responses for the Gamma test of M2

## Notes
If you are trying to use this, just note that it was developed for use on a Mac and is highly dependent on specific filepath locations.  These are used for data input from the individual cook files pulled from AWS as well as outputting graph images.  

## ToDos:
* Verify cook is valid (some are very short and not a full cook...)
* Cleaner use of filepaths for different updates
* Improved accounting for cooks with multiple errors (currently only accounting for 1 error per cook
